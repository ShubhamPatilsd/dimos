"""No-op AgentSpec implementation.

Satisfies the AgentSpec protocol so that skills that require an AgentSpec
(e.g. PerceiveLoopSkill, PersonFollowSkillContainer) can be loaded even when
there is no real agent loop (e.g. the MCP-server-only blueprint where Claude
Code is the external agent).  Push notifications from those skills are silently
dropped.
